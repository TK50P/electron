            Hello @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}. Thanks for reporting this and helping to make Electron better!

            Would it be possible for you to make a standalone testcase with only the code necessary to reproduce the issue? For example, [Electron Fiddle](https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle) is a great tool for making small test cases and makes it easy to publish your test case to a [gist](https://gist.github.com) that Electron maintainers can use.

            Stand-alone test cases make fixing issues go more smoothly: it ensure everyone's looking at the same issue, it removes all unnecessary variables from the equation, and it can also provide the basis for automated regression tests.

            Now adding the `blocked/need-repro` label for this reason. After you make a test case, please link to it in a followup comment. This issue will be closed in 10 days if the above is not addressed.
